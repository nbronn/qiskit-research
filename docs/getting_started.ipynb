One common method is the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition, in which the total evolution time $t$ is broken into `num_steps` $N$.

    "\n",
    "In general problems must respect the layout of the actual quantum hardware. Due to limited connectivity, this often entails doing SWAP operations to move quantum information around. SWAPs are costly in the sense they consist of three `CX`s. The Qiskit transpiler with `optimization_level=3` uses the [SABRE SWAP method](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02573), which is efficient, however stochastic, since the SWAP-mapping problem is NP-hard. Here we do it several time and take the solution with the lowest CNOT count. This operation serves only to minimize the number of SWAPs in the transpiled circuits, and is not aware of noise on the underlying qubits. That is considered in a following step."

Since the transpiler mapped the circuit to physical qubits, we must first \"deflate\" the circuits with `deflate_circuit` (which removes idle qubits), finds the layouts with `matching_layouts`, then scores those layouts due to error rates, which are calculated by a cost function that may be specified by the user, see [`mapomatic`](https://github.com/Qiskit-Partners/mapomatic) documentation for how. The default cost function includes errors determined for each qubit gates and measurements, although not decoherence/relaxation caused by idle time, producing an *infidelity score* where the lowest number is the preferred layout."

This method first uses a greedy algorithm called [template opimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05270) to identify parts of the circuit that can be substituted by $R_{ZX}$ rotations.

    "## Dynamical Decoupling\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamical decoupling (DD) is a way of modifying the noise power spectrum $S(\\omega)$ observed by qubits (see [this recent review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03670)), and is typically implemented by a sequence of gates scheduled during a given qubit idle time that compose to the identity with specific delay times to fill the idle time in a calculated manner. Considerations for which sequences to use may involve decoherent error due to idle time versus single-qubit gate errors and/or crosstalk during two-qubit gates. Because the addition of gates is not always in the set of `basis_gates` defined by the backend, `add_pulse_cals=True` uses [Pulse Gates](https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/circuits_advanced/05_pulse_gates.html) to add the correct implementation to the circuit with added DD."
